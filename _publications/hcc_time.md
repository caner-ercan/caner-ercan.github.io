As the main project of my PhD, this study investigated the tumor immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for the first time following the Immuno-Oncology Working Groupâ€™s recommendations. The project demonstrated the applicability and significance of microscopic evaluation of immune responses and their relationship with patient prognosis, histology, and tumor heterogeneity. Additionally, we developed a computational pathology tool to analyze slides with accuracy, interpretability, and reproducibility.
