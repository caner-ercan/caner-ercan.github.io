This study aimed to develop a computational pathology tool to analyze liver biopsies for autoimmune hepatitis. Current evaluations rely on semi-qualitative assessments by pathologists under a microscope. Our tool enhances reproducibility in these assessments while introducing fully quantitative evaluations for improved pathological insights.
