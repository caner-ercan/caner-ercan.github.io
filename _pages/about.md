Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at MD Anderson Cancer Center, where I work in quantitative analysis and insight extraction by computational pathology focused [Yuan labratory](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/labs/yuan-laboratory.html).

As a researcher specializing in computational and translational pathology with a focus on cancer research, I am dedicated to developing computational image analysis tools and uncovering clinically relevant aspects of the immune microenvironment in cancer development and prognosis. Following the completion of my pathology residency, I began my research career under the mentorship of Prof. Terracciano, a leading expert in gastrointestinal and liver pathology at the University of Basel, Switzerland. During my PhD, I gained extensive experience in computational and translational pathology, particularly within the gastrointestinal system.

My training in computational image analysis and translational research has uniquely positioned me as a pathologist to make significant contributions to research focused on cancer development and prognosis. Upon completing my PhD, I joined Prof. Yuan’s lab to further enhance my expertise in computational pathology. Currently, I am engaged in ecological analysis of Barrett’s esophagus, utilizing state-of-the-art image analysis methods under Prof. Yuan’s supervision.

My passion for advancing the field of computational pathology, combined with my commitment to fostering collaboration and conducting impactful research, makes me a highly qualified candidate for this project. I am enthusiastic about contributing my expertise to deepen our understanding of Barrett's esophagus and its potential progression to cancer.
